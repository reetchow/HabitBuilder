# HabitBuilder
Get good grades, build new skills, and save your marriage by getting HabitBuilder today! HabitBuilder allows you to monitor your
own habits on a weekly basis. Check off which things you did on which day. Play guitar on Tuesday? Checked. Read the Book of Mormon
on Wednesday? Check. HabitBuilder allows you to see your progess.

HabitBuilder has several user interface features that make it fairly intuitive to use, such as dragging to swap, sliding to delete,
and usage of the back button to traverse back to a previous page. Unfortunately, due to lack of time, a major feature was cut short 
from the project - local storage saving. We were *this* close to completing it. We did finish it, however, we just didn't have time 
to "fit it" in with our actual android project (We wrote the algorithm in Pure Java). With 2 or 3 more hours, I'm 95% positive this
could have been done. We came up with our own save structure using Stacks and Queues to save a tree with an infinite number of branchs 
and an infinite number of levels (hence meanign the user could create as many habit items and sub-habit items as we want) - which is
why it's such a shame we didn't get to implement it (believe me because I spent most of my time on the project writing it - Cameron). 

You can view our final project inside of the habitB folder. I would just download it and open it using Android Studio.

All of the program files are based off Reet's branch. Please note that his branch was pushed before 11:59 pm. Unfortunately, we thought
if we knew how to push and pull we would easily remember how to push back to the master branch...woops.

You should view the SaveFileAlgorithmBranch. A lot of unpublished blood, sweat, and tears went into that. It was basically a feature
we were *this* close to implementing but ran out of time.

So, the only two branchs you should care about are master and SaveFileAgorithmForJava branch. I would disregard any on others, except
for maybe Reet's just for time verification.
