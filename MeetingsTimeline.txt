Everyone attended the meetings

11/24/15 - First meeting, worked on Android tutorials and discussed possible features for the program. We have also made some decisions such as create
	 - an object called listView to display

12/02 - We have checkboxes and are working out a way to display a list of habitItems

12/04 - We have decided to use a listview, though this is becoming tricky when trying to display objects rather than strings.

12/05 - We have met again, but we still are struggling to get a ListView to work. We spend most the day just trying to find a set of code that works.

12/06 - We have successfully implemented a listview. Somewhere between all these meetings we decided that the best option for the rest of our time should
        be to add the ability to traverse the HabitItems.

12/07 - Implementing several items turns out to be fairly manageable. Cameron suggests that saving files could be extremely difficult with a tree structure.
	Cameron goes into the back to churn out a save file format.

12/08 - A save file algorithm is established (though not implemented). Reet has improved the page traversal. While we are able to traverse, we can't do 
        basic things such as add, delete, or save checkbox states after a traversal.

12/09 - Our program now saves state after traversing, though it still cannot add or save. Cameron is writing the save algorithm in pure Java to test before
        implementing in the final program.
12/10 - No meeting
12/11 - We finish add, delete. We also add the ability to drag habits across. The saving algorithm is complete, but implementing it in the program turned out
      - to be harder than expected. Saving is not included in the final project. Though the algorithm would work with some small modification.
